## My learning path

# product_management
Introduce the basics of product management in four steps (based on the Udacity Product manager course).
The first step is to form a vision, followed by the design phase and development iteration, and finally the goto market strategy. 
Including a PRD (Product Requirement Document) that comes with the product.

Product Managers are responsible for designing and delivering a profitable product or feature into the market. In this program, you will learn to define product strategy and KPIs based on market analysis, pitch a product vision to get stakeholder buy-in, and design a user-centered prototype that adheres to engineering constraints. Then, you will develop an execution timeline that handles competing priorities, communicate a product roadmap that builds consensus amongst internal stakeholders, and create a comprehensive go-to-market plan based on product KPIs. Finally, you will build tests to enhance product features based on market data.

# Data Product Manager
Leverage market data to amplify product development. Learn how to apply data science techniques, data engineering processes, and market experimentation tests to deliver customized product experiences. Begin by leveraging the power of SQL and Tableau to inform product strategy. Then, develop data pipelines and warehousing strategies that prepare data collected from a product for robust analysis. Finally, learn techniques for evaluating the data from live products, including how to design and execute various A/B and multivariate tests to shape the next iteration of a product.

Finally, you will learn the ins and outs of monetization, from designing pricing plans to determining optimal price points using pricing metrics.
