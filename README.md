## Product Manager program [finished]
Product Managers are responsible for designing and delivering a profitable product or feature into the market.  In this program, you will learn to define product strategy and KPIs based on market analysis, pitch a product vision to get stakeholder buy-in, and design a user-centered prototype that adheres to engineering constraints. Then, you will develop an execution timeline that handles competing priorities, communicate a product roadmap that builds consensus amongst internal stakeholders, and create a comprehensive go-to-market plan based on product KPIs. Finally, you will build tests to enhance product features based on market data.

#### Product documents
* [product vision](https://github.com/ZahoreczTibor/product_management/blob/main/product_management/First_Step_Create_Vision.pdf)  
The most effective products start with a comprehensive market-based, insight-driven strategy. Identify the right problems to solve through market research, target user definition, and market sizing. Create a compelling vision and strategy that will set up the team to solve those problems.  
* [design sprint](https://github.com/ZahoreczTibor/product_management/blob/main/product_management/Second_Step_Design_Sprint.pdf)  
Take an idea through concept, design, and user validation phases, and create a spec to handoff to Engineering for development. Use design-thinking methodologies to explore various ideas, and then converge on a single idea. Map out the full concept through creation of a prototype that can be used to validate that you’re solving a problem for real users.
* [product development](https://github.com/ZahoreczTibor/product_management/blob/main/product_management/Third_Step_Product_Dev.pdf)  
Critical soft skills needed to manage the development and execution phase of the product. Collaborate with cross-functional teams and stakeholders to guide them through planning and execution. Manage stakeholder expectations and handle risks that arise, reprioritizing feature and sprint priorities to tackle competing requests.
* [PRD & go-to-market](https://github.com/ZahoreczTibor/product_management/blob/main/product_management/PRD_Final_Step_Goto_Market.pdf)  
Create a plan, identify the launch risks, and figure out how to minimize their impact on your launch. Collaborate with a variety of teams including Marketing, Sales, Customer Support, and more to prepare them to interface with customers as the product is launched. Execute the launch and use feedback from your customers to determine the next steps for your product.


## AI product manager [finished]
Evaluate the business value of an AI product. Start by building familiarity and fluency with common AI concepts. Learn how to scope and build a data set, train a model, and evaluate its business impact. Ensure a product is successful by focusing on scalability, potential biases, and compliance.

[Certificate](https://github.com/ZahoreczTibor/product_management/blob/main/certs/AIPMND.pdf)
#### Product documents
* [build a model](https://github.com/ZahoreczTibor/product_management/blob/main/AIPM/build_model_Google_AutoML.pdf)  
How a neural network produces a decision and how “training” works. Use training data and how to evaluate the results of a model.
* [UX plan](https://github.com/ZahoreczTibor/product_management/blob/main/AIPM/UX_chatbot-research-plan.pdf)
* [Create AI Product proposal](https://github.com/ZahoreczTibor/product_management/blob/main/AIPM/Create_AP_Product_Proposal.pdf)  
How to measure post-deployment impact, and how to make data-informed improvements on your model. Understand how to avoid unwanted bias, ensure security and compliance, and how to scale your product.
#### Technical side
* [AI certification](https://github.com/ZahoreczTibor/product_management/blob/main/certs/AIND.pdf)
* [Deeplearning specialization](https://github.com/ZahoreczTibor/Deeplearning.ai-course)
* [AI capstone project](https://github.com/ZahoreczTibor/AIND-VUI-Capstone)  
Build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline. The model will convert raw audio into feature representations, which will then turn them into transcribed text.

# Data Product Manager
Leverage market data to amplify product development. Learn how to apply data science techniques, data engineering processes, and market experimentation tests to deliver customized product experiences. Begin by leveraging the power of SQL and Tableau to inform product strategy. Then, develop data pipelines and warehousing strategies that prepare data collected from a product for robust analysis. Finally, learn techniques for evaluating the data from live products, including how to design and execute various A/B and multivariate tests to shape the next iteration of a product.

# Growth Product Manager
During the Growth Product Manager Nanodegree program, you will learn to build acquisition funnels, identify core customers, and optimize growth loop models. Then, you will learn how to analyze your results and make improvements to your strategies. Next, you will learn activation theories on how to decrease time-to-value and friction for both B2C and B2B product users, as well as retention theories, for creating audiences and increasing engagement. Finally, you will learn the ins and outs of monetization, from designing pricing plans to determining optimal price points using pricing metrics.

# UX Designer
You’ll learn how to create a digital user experience that is ready to be handed off for development. You’ll start by building familiarity and fluency with design research fundamentals to identify the user and the solutions they need. You’ll then synthesize your research, and use design sprints to take an idea from concept to low-fidelity prototype. Finally, you’ll learn how to turn your low-fidelity prototype into a high-fidelity design, and improve its performance based on data. Along the way, you’ll complete projects that can be incorporated into a UX portfolio at the end of the program in order to showcase your capabilities to future employers.
